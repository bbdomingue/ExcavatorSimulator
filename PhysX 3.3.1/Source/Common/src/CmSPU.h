// AP: Need to map from SPU_RAYCAST_MODULE to IS_SPU_RAYCAST and such because xpj doesn't support macros with values AFAIK
// These macros enable different query types in NpBatchQuery::execute; this in turn pulls in all the other necessary code.
// All unused code will then be stripped by the linker, so this is the only place where we differentiate between the 3 SPU modules.
