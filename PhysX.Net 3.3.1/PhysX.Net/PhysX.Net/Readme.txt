PhysX.Net Readme
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the following files as references to your project
	StillDesign.PhysX.Net.dll

Copy the following PhysX 2.8.4 runtime files into your application path:
	NxCharacter.dll
	PhysXCooking.dll
	PhysXCore.dll
	PhysXDevice.dll
	PhysXLoader.dll

	These are usually in -
		x86: C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA PhysX SDK\v2.8.4_win\Bin\win32
		x64: C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA PhysX SDK\v2.8.4_win\Bin\win64
Create a new StillDesign.PhysX.Core instance in your code.

Most of the class and function names are the same as in the official PhysX documentation, minus the 'Nx' prefix

Differences between PhysX.Net and the official PhysX Lib:
	The empty constructors for Bounds3 and NxBounds3 create different results.
	Bounds3 is a ValueType (struct) so calling the empty constructor can only leave the Min and Max properties
	as ( 0, 0, 0 ) where as in 
	NxBounds3 they are effectively set to Min=(MaxFloat, MaxFloat, MaxFloat) and Max=(MinFloat, MinFloat, MinFloat).
	Use Bounds3 mybounds = Bounds3.Extremes; instead.
	
	Change in the naming, NxPhysicsSDK is called Core.
